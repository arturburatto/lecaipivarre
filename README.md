I made this website mostly for fun but also as way of putting my knowledge in HTML and CSS to pratice. It simulates a restaurant website, with the menu being composed by some of the most infamous foods made by me and my friends throughout our 5 years of hanging out together, and a funny description to each option. It mostly consists of internal jokes.

I certainly could've done better in the design part, and also could've used waay less CSS than I actually did, but I intend to update the website in the near future with some of this improvementes, also adding some animations with Javascript
